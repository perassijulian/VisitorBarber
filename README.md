# Visitor barber

Project proposed by a friend who works as a home hairdresser and barber. The requirement is to be a website in the style of PedidosYa, Uber, Airbnb, etc. where service providers register and users can view their profiles. 

### Showcase

## Focus

First big project I face. Although in this repository I focused mainly on the front end, I tried to do it from scratch to reaffirm my knowledge in React.js and avoid using external front end modules (the only one used was the carousel).

## Concepts

The main concepts that I reaffirmed doing this project were the concept of composable component, the use of mapping for rendering, the determination of requirements, conditional rendering, the use of SASS variables and mixin, starting with responsive design, etc.

## Status

While it is not a completed project, I am not currently working on this repository. The reason is that I'm focusing on the backend part and then I will resume this repo.


### Stack

The stack used is React.js and SASS as CSS processor.
